# About Me

I am currently investigating the multiphase circumgalactic medium using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with Prof. Mark Voit and Prof. Brian O'Shea.

I am the author of the [Quokka](https://github.com/BenWibking/quokka) radiation hydrodynamics code, which has demonstrated excellent performance on GPU-based  exascale computing architectures.

My previous work in cosmology used Gaussian Process-based emulators of simulations of structure formation to infer cosmological parameters from galaxy-shear cross-correlations on nonperturbative scales using galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).

# Research

## Precipitation in galactic atmospheres
I have investigated stratified thermal instability in the ICM/CGM to see under what conditions hot gas precipitates, sinks, and accretes on the AGN that heats and self-regulates the galaxy cluster or group atmosphere [[Read more...]](precipitation.html)
