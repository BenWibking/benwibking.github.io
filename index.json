We show that extending clustering+GGL analyses from the linear regime down to $\\sim 0.5 \\, h^{-1}$ Mpc scales increases their constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model of non-linear galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation $\\xi\\_{gg}$ and galaxy-matter cross-correlation $\\xi\\_{gm}$ as a function of $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_m$, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large scale environment to represent possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density $\\sim 0.3$ arcmin$^{-2}$). Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over 0.5 ≤ $r_p$ ≤ 30 $h^{-1}$ Mpc yields a 2% constraint on the parameter combination $\\sigma_8 \\Omega_m^{0.6}$, a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales ($r_p$  2 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, 4 $h^{-1}$ Mpc for $\\gamma_t$, $w_p$). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters. Increasing the effective source density to 3 arcmin$^{-2}$ sharpens the constraint on $\\sigma_8 \\Omega_m^{0.6}$ by a further factor of two. With robust modeling into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-percent level with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the Dark Energy Survey.","tags":[],"title":"Emulating galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing into the deeply nonlinear regime: methodology, information, and forecasts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manodeep Sinha","Andreas A.

Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models statistically. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the 'accurate' regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling approach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) + halo model against the clustering of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) seventh data release (DR7) galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity function, and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model fits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir haloes) matches the clustering of low-luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a 2.3σ tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the 'standard' halo model needs to be extended. This work opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Towards accurate modelling of galaxy clustering on small scales: testing the standard $\\Lambda$CDM + halo model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin D.

Recent studies focus on the highly optically thick limit relevant to the densest ultraluminous galaxies and super star clusters, where reprocessed infrared photons provide the dominant source of electromagnetic momentum. However, even among starburst galaxies, the great majority instead lie in the so-called 'single-scattering' limit, where the system is optically thick to the incident starlight, but optically thin to the reradiated infrared. In this paper, we present a stability analysis and multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations exploring the stability and dynamics of isothermal dusty gas columns in this regime. We describe our algorithm for full angle-dependent radiation transport based on the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. For a range of near-Eddington fluxes, we show that the medium is unstable, producing convective-like motions in a turbulent atmosphere with a scale height significantly inflated compared to the gas pressure scale height and mass-weighted turbulent energy densities of $\\sim 0.01--0.1$ of the mid-plane radiation energy density, corresponding to mass-weighted velocity dispersions of Mach number $\\sim 0.5--2$. Extrapolation of our results to optical depths of $10^3$ implies maximum turbulent Mach numbers of $\\sim 20$. Comparing our results to galaxy-averaged observations, and subject to the approximations of our calculations, we find that radiation pressure does not contribute significantly to the effective supersonic pressure support in star-forming discs, which in general are substantially sub-Eddington. We further examine the time-averaged vertical density profiles in dynamical equilibrium and comment on implications for radiation-pressure-driven galactic winds.","tags":[],"title":"Radiation pressure in galactic discs: stability, turbulence, and winds in the single-scattering limit","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the **Slides** button above to view the built-in slides feature.
